# Joel Spinelli's Personal Portfolio

Webpage made with React to display some basic information about myself and show some projects I made.

It features:
* A projects section in which other works made by me can be seen.
* A fully functional contact form that allows the user to directly send me an email without leaving the website. 
* An accessible and fully responsive UI that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (AAA).

To build it I used the following: 
* React 
* NodeJS 
* Express 
* Sass

## In case you want to run this project in your local environment: 
To build it, I used Node v16.15.1 and npm v8.11.0.

1. npm install
2. npm start (run a development server for the front end of the app)
3. npm run serverDevStart (run a development back end server, necessary for the mailer form)

Make sure that the proxy address (declared inside of package.json) matches with the port in which you are running your back end server. 

I don't claim ownership for any of the images used on it (beside the ones that include myself in them).
