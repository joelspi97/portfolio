# Joel Spinelli's Personal Portfolio

Webpage made with React to display some basic information about myself and show some projects I made.

It features:
* A projects section in which other works made by me can be seen.
* A fully functional contact form that allows the user to directly send me an email without leaving the website. 
* An accessible and fully responsive UI that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (AAA).

To build it I used the following: 
* React 
* NodeJS 
* Express 
* Sass

## In case you want to run this project in your local environment: 
You need to have both node and npm installed on your computer. I recommend installing them by using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm), otherwise you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en). 

To build this project I used Node v16.15.1 and npm v8.11.0, so it's also advisable that you use the same versions.

Follow these steps: 
1. Open the project on your preferred code editor. 
2. Open a terminal and go inside the backend directory: **cd backend** 
3. Run the following command: **npm run devStart**
4. Open a new terminal and go inside the frontend directory: **cd frontend**
5. Run the following command: **npm start**

Make sure that the proxy address (declared inside of package.json) matches with the port in which you are running your back end server. 

I don't claim ownership for any of the images used on it (beside the ones that include myself in them).
