# Joel Spinelli's Personal Portfolio

Webpage made with React to display some basic information about myself and show some projects I made.

It features:
* A projects section in which other works made by me can be seen.
* A fully functional contact form that allows the user to directly send me an email without leaving the website. 
* An accessible and fully responsive UI that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (AAA).

To build it I used the following: 
* React 
* NodeJS 
* Express 
* Sass
