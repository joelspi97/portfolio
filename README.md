# Joel Spinelli's Personal Portfolio

Webpage made to display some basic information about myself and show some projects I made.

It features:
* A projects section in which other works made by me can be seen.
* A contact form that uses a Node.js + Express server in order to send me emails.
* An accessible and fully responsive UI that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (AAA).

To build this portfolio I used:
* React
* Node.js
* Express
* Sass
